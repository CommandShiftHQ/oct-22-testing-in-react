# Oct 22 Testing in React lecture

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It is built on a demo repo used for the react intro 2 lecture, a simple blog style posts page built using useState and basic event handlers.

Here we will using Jest, React testing library and React test renderer to add tests that:
- create snapshots
- fetch elements using queries
- validate elements on screen using matchers
- mock functions with Jest
- validate functions are being called when triggering an event listener

## Setup
Clone down the repo, and `cd` and into the new directory. If you want to start from the same place as we did at the start of the lecture, simply run `npm i` then `npm start`

If you want to see the finished app as it was at the end of the session, you will need to checkout the `completed` branch on this repo. You can do that by running
```
git checkout -t origin/completed
```
which will pull down the completed branch to your local environment (you will have to run `npm i` to update the new dependencies)

## Starting point of app
